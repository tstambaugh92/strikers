"""
Generate stubs for the few symbols the port does not supply.

The point is to reach a *link*. Compiling every translation unit proves the
sources are portable; linking proves the symbol graph closes, which is a
different and stricter claim, and it is the gate before anything can run.

What is left to stub is small and known: Aurora's missing EFB peek and poke,
ODE's LCP solver, and a handful of debug classes whose methods live in files
the decomp deliberately excludes. Each missing symbol gets a zero-argument
function carrying an explicit asm label, so the definition satisfies the
linker under the exact (already-mangled) name the reference uses. Calling one
aborts with its name, so anything the game turns out to need announces itself
instead of crashing anonymously; the ones passed with --noop return 0 silently.

Every stub has to match a line of tools/genstubs.allow, or this exits 1 after
writing the file. A new missing symbol is a translation unit that did not
compile, a declaration two files disagree about, or a function the port owes,
and each of those is a decision to make in the open rather than a stub to find
at runtime. STRIKERS_ACCEPT_NEW_STUBS=1, or --accept-new-stubs, links anyway.

Symbols the host libraries provide, libc, libm, libc++, libc++abi; are NOT
stubbed; they resolve at link time and stubbing them would shadow the real ones.
